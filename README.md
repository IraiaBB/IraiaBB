## Hi! I'm IraiaðŸ‘‹

### About me :raising_hand: 
- I was born in 1996, and I grew up along with the Internet and the technology, as we know it today :tv:         
- I live in el Maresme, in a town close to Barcelona :sunrise: :sunrise_over_mountains:         
- Last year I ended a programming vocational training and I'm currently **looking for my first job** :mortar_board: :fireworks:   
- When I'm not programming I watch videos or listen to music with my pet :dog: . I also like reading historical novels :books: , watching football matches :soccer:
with my family and hanging out with my friends :dancer:   

### Coder girl :computer:
- I began to program 5 years ago. I passed and exam and started the vocational training :memo:   
- I chose this because I have a very logical mind and I'm very perfectionist :triangular_ruler:    
- My best quality is the learning capacity :bulb:    
- What I love the most is backend programming and data manipulation :file_folder:   

### Skills and tools :dart: :wrench:

### The future :crystal_ball:    
I hope to find a job where I'd learn a lot of things, in terms of knowledge and professional experience. I also expect to gain in self-assurance to be more competitive. And, of course, to see more girls around here! My long-term goal is Data Science, specially Machine Learning and fullfil my passion for data manipulation.
